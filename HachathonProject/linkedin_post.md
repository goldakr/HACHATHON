## Option 1: Impact-Focused (Recommended)

🚨 Postpartum Depression affects 1 in 7 women, yet early detection remains a challenge in healthcare.

I'm excited to share my latest project: an **AI-powered Postpartum Depression Risk Prediction System** that combines machine learning with explainable AI to help healthcare professionals identify at-risk patients early.

🔬 **What makes this special:**
✅ Dual ML models (XGBoost & Random Forest) with hyperparameter optimization
✅ SHAP explainability - every prediction comes with transparent, interpretable insights
✅ EPDS conversational agent using LangChain for natural language patient screening
✅ Multi-source data integration (demographics, clinical, psychiatric, psychosocial factors)
✅ Interactive web interface built with Gradio

💡 **The technical stack:**
• Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost
• SHAP for explainable AI
• LangChain for conversational AI
• FastAPI for API deployment
• Comprehensive data visualization

This project demonstrates how AI can be both powerful AND transparent - crucial for healthcare applications where trust and interpretability matter.

The system analyzes multiple risk factors and provides healthcare professionals with actionable insights, complete with feature importance explanations. Every prediction is backed by SHAP values showing exactly which factors contributed to the risk assessment.

🎯 **Key takeaway:** Building AI systems for healthcare requires more than just accuracy - it needs explainability, domain knowledge integration, and user-friendly interfaces.

I'm passionate about using AI to solve real-world healthcare challenges. What other applications of explainable AI in healthcare have you seen?

• Optimized 9 hyperparameters for XGBoost (n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, regularization, etc.)
• Cross-validation with stratified train-test split
• Model persistence for production deployment
• Feature importance visualization with SHAP waterfall plots
• ROC AUC as primary evaluation metric

💻 **Tech Stack:**
Python | scikit-learn | XGBoost | SHAP | LangChain | OpenAI API | Gradio | FastAPI | Pandas | NumPy

🎯 **Key Features:**
✅ Explainable AI - every prediction includes SHAP-based feature importance
✅ Domain knowledge integration - medical rule-based risk adjustments
✅ EPDS conversational agent with Hebrew language support
✅ Comprehensive visualizations (ROC curves, confusion matrices, correlation heatmaps)
✅ Model comparison and performance tracking

The project showcases full-stack ML development: from data preprocessing to model deployment, with a focus on explainability - essential for healthcare applications.

## Option 3: Problem-Solution Format

**The Challenge:** Postpartum Depression affects millions of women worldwide, but early detection is difficult. Healthcare professionals need tools that are both accurate AND explainable.

**The Solution:** I developed an AI-powered risk prediction system that:

🎯 Predicts PPD risk using multiple data sources
🔍 Explains every prediction with SHAP values
💬 Conducts natural language EPDS screening via conversational AI
📊 Provides comprehensive visualizations for clinical decision support

**Technical Implementation:**
• XGBoost & Random Forest models with hyperparameter optimization
• SHAP explainability for transparent predictions
• LangChain agent for patient-friendly EPDS screening
• Multi-source data integration (demographics, clinical, psychiatric data)
• Interactive Gradio interface for healthcare professionals

**Why This Matters:**
In healthcare AI, accuracy alone isn't enough. Clinicians need to understand WHY a patient is at risk. This system provides both - high accuracy AND complete transparency through SHAP explanations.

Every prediction shows:
• Risk probability
• Top contributing factors
• Feature importance visualization
• Personalized explanations

Building AI systems that healthcare professionals can trust requires explainability, domain knowledge, and user-centered design.
